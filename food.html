<h3>1. Introduction:</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>The modern education landscape has been significantly transformed by technological advancements, with traditional classrooms replaced by digital screens. This shift is not only due to technological evolution but also a response to global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated a swift shift to remote learning. Edtech, or educational technology, has played a pivotal role in this transformation, redefining the boundaries of education by offering video-assisted remote education and immersive and on-demand learning modules.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This has made learning more accessible, breaking down geographical barriers and offering flexibility in schedules. The government has launched policies like the national education policy 2020, emphasizing the importance of harnessing technology to enhance educational accessibility. However, this rapid transition comes with challenges and questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The impact of online learning platforms on academic performance is a topic of interest. This research aims to investigate the nuances of online education, its benefits, challenges, and implications for the future of learning. By shedding light on the nuances of online education, its benefits, challenges, and implications, this research aims to shed light on the future of learning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>2. Rationale of Study:</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>The shift towards digital platforms in education is a significant shift in modern pedagogy. While online learning offers increased accessibility and flexibility, its academic outcomes remain a topic of debate. The surge in online learning, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has highlighted both strengths and potential weaknesses of digital education.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While it provides quality education without geographical constraints, concerns about student engagement, online assessments&apos; effectiveness, and potential loss of interpersonal skills development have emerged. As investments in edtech grow, stakeholders need insights into the return on these investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of online learning&apos;s impact on academic performance, guiding educational strategies and informing future investments in edtech. The findings will ensure the digital transformation of education yields positive outcomes for all involved.</p>

<h3>5. Literature Review:</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>The rapid evolution of technology and the global shift towards digitalization have paved the way for online learning platforms to emerge as significant tools in the educational sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the adoption of digital learning systems, with a study by Abu Elnasr in Egypt revealing that Social Network Applications (SNAs) like Facebook and WhatsApp significantly impact students&apos; academic performance, especially in developing countries with limited resources and infrastructure. This suggests that the future use of social media applications in higher education, particularly in developing nations, may be beneficial. (Sobaih et al., 2022).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A research conducted in Malaysia utilized mixed methods to analyze university students&apos; perceptions of challenges faced when using IT platform applications for online learning. The study emphasized the importance of understanding the hurdles students encounter in the digital learning environment.(Al-Kumaim, 2021).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Indonesia, a study on the e-learning platform at ITB STIKOM Bali revealed that the platform met the criteria of the TAM theory, emphasizing the perception of usefulness and user convenience. This has been instrumental in enhancing students&apos; academic performance.(Maharani et al., 2022).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>6. Method of Analysis:</h3>
<p>The research will use a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of online learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quantitative analysis will involve structured online surveys distributed to students, focusing on academic performance, platform usage frequency, and satisfaction. Statistical analysis will identify patterns and differences between online and traditional learning outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qualitative analysis will involve semi-structured interviews with students, educators, and platform administrators, examining challenges and perceived advantages. Thematic analysis will identify recurring themes and patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Expected Results:</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>Online learning platforms may impact students&apos; academic performance differently than traditional classroom settings. While flexibility and accessibility may improve performance, some students may face challenges due to lack of face-to-face interactions. Engagement and retention may be higher due to convenience, but knowledge retention may vary based on platform quality and teaching methodologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Students may face technological and pedagogical challenges, such as connectivity issues and isolation, while benefits like flexibility and self-paced learning may be emphasized. Feedback from them may reveal which subjects are better suited for online teaching, while they benefit from traditional classroom interactions. Future recommendations may include optimizing online learning platforms, enhancing teaching methodologies, and providing additional support from educators to improve academic outcomes.</p>
<h3>8. The Work Plan and Budget:</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>The research project is strategically planned over a span of six weeks with a total budget of 7,000 BDT. The project will begin with a literature review, followed by data collection from Dhaka&apos;s monitoring stations. Data analysis will be conducted in weeks 3 and 4, identifying trends and correlations. Results interpretation and report drafting will be done in week 5, proposing solutions to improve air quality. The final week will involve revising the report and preparing it for submission.</p>
